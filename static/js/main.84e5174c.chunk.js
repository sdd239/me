One time, we crossed the English Channel to go to England and spent some time there. I do remember a lot of that vacation, it was fantastic! I have always been an outdoor kid, loved to play soccer or other outdoor games with the neighbor kids. This brought me some good, reliable friend in Eindhoven! \nI do have an entrepreneurial mindset.
